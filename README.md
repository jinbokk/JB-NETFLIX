# JINBOK NETFLIX PROJECT

![portfolio_netflix](https://github.com/jinbokk/JB-NETFLIX/assets/101123079/5ea2eea3-6449-4ba0-a744-b1b37c7d574e)

I developed a website inspired by Netflix's design, focusing on user interactions.

Similar to the actual Netflix, the main page automatically plays trailer videos and hovering over movie cards triggers the playback of trailer videos. 

Additionally, I implemented features that allow users to search for movies based on genres, release years, and more. 

Users can also access details such as the cast and reviews of a particular movie.

    Users have the ability to watch movie trailers directly on the website.
    This feature allows users to quickly preview movies and make informed decisions.

## Lessons Learned

I have learned the following during this project:

* I've learned how to manage an application's state using React-Redux
